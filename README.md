# SpotiSong

## Description
SpotiSong is a game based on the popular game, Heardle, where you need to guess the song from listening to a small 2-3 second clip. Use those ears!

## Rules
1. Click 'play' to hear the song. If you know it, type the name into the guess box.
2. If you don't know it or need to hear more, then click the +3s button.
3. Continue the above steps until you either guess the song or run out of time!
